## Abstract
As the power grid in the contiguous United States (CONUS) is decarbonized through the integration of 
additional wind and solar generation, hydropower is an essential source of dispatchable generation and 
energy storage to support this transition. In addition, climate impacts on watersheds have the 
potential to exercabate water scarcity issues where water serves multiple purposes. To date, there has 
been no comprehensive assessment of the potential impact of climate change on hydropower production 
across the entire CONUS fleet, encompassing both federal and non-federal facilities, that can support 
the needs of both energy planners and water managers. We present an assessment of future hydropower 
production using one climate change socioeconomic scenario, SSP5-8.5, and a multi-model ensemble 
approach to account for uncertainties at each step of the modeling chain. We present regional 
hydropower projections, using both balancing authority (BA) regions and HUC4 watersheds to consistently 
inform the energy and water communities at decision-relevant scales, for two future periods – the near-
term (2020-2039) and the mid-term (2040-2059) relative to a historical baseline period (1980-2019). We 
find that the median projected changes in mean annual hydropower generation are typically positive – 
approximately 5% near-term, and 10% in the mid-term. BAs in the southwest however show a modest 
decrease in generation, ranging from 3% to 6%. Median, 5th and 95th percentile projections are 
presented to capture the uncertainty found in future hydropower availablity. This is the first CONUS-
wide assessment that provides a consistent quantitative understanding of how much hydropower is 
available to support electricity grid decarbonization and a net-zero economy transition. The assessment 
informs regional utilities and regulators in developing scenarios for electricity resources adequacy 
planning, and water managers in understanding how climate change impacts hydropower production in 
watersheds across CONUS, and particular in locations with water scarcity issues.
